#### Weekly Report 3
This week my generator started working and currently it is able to generate a new MIDI file based on the source MIDI file. Different degrees for sequences also work. For note durations there are currently 2 modes: every note is the same length or note lengths are taken directly from the source MIDI. I'm planning to create an option for randomized note lengths based on the bars in the source MIDI. 

I started working on the GUI and I think that is my next priority. Also testing and pylint are currently lacking so they will be on the to do list.
