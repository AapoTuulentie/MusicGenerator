#### Weekly Report 2
This week I did some research about the trie data structure and wasted too much time trying to figure out how I would implement it to this application. I think I finally figured it out now and created a Trie-class that for now includes a function for trie creation (create_trie) and a function for picking a random sequence from the trie (which is meant for testing out stuff). I also made a MIDI parsing algorithm and decided to separate notes and durations for now. I still need to figure out how to handle note durations. Also fixed the design document. 

Also did a couple of tests
