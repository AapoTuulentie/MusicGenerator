## Design Document
MusicGenerator is meant to be an application for generating musical compositions using a Markov chain algorithm. It should take existing musical data, process it and use a Markov chain to create new sequences.
#### Algorithm Design
Data collection and processing algorithms receive a MIDI-file as input and construct a Markov chain from the notes in the file. Attributes such as note sequences and durations are extracted. When a Markov chain is formed, a generator algorithm will generate new music based on probabilities in the chain. The goal is to try generating music with at least first- and second-order Markov chains. Second-order Markov chain needs to know the probability of transitioning to next state, considering the current and previous states.
Time complexity for a second-order Markov chain algorithm would be O(nÂ³), with n being the number of states.
#### Data Structures
A Markov chain is a transition matrix that holds data about notes and transition probabilities. The Markov chain has N possible states and the matrix will be an NxN matrix.
