I decided to choose music generation with Markov chain as my subject. I familiarized myself with how Markov chain works and wrote the design document. I think I got an alright view of what kind of algorithms I am going to need in this project. I am not sure about many details yet, but tentatively I wrote overall definition of the project. Next, I will start with the midi-file parser.
